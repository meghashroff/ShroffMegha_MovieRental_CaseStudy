# Technical Specification
***

    This application is created using Spring MVC and Spring Data JPA framework. The view pages are created using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Java Server Pages. This application uses MariaDb as the database.

    The JSP pages make use of various tags, images, tables and forms of HTML. The forms include text boxes, drop down boxes and submit buttons. The text on the pages are displayed in web fonts. 

    The styles on the pages are done using CSS3. The styles on the sheets are incorporating inline, internal and external styling. The CSS stylesheets use different selectors such as tag selectors, selector combinators, by class, by id and by pseudo classes.

    The front end validation for the forms is written in Javascript . The scripts are external scripts and are linked in the pages. The javascript files make use of variables, if statements, retrieves collections and iterates over the collection using for loops. It also includes functions/call back methods and invokes the event handler when an event is triggered.

# Challenges
    This application uses Spring Data JPA. One of the biggest challenges I faced was during the implementation process. 
    When a user, selects movie(s) to rent, the data would not persist in the data base. I had to change the way I was creating the relationship table and continue with the development of the application.
